# Compute

## Compute Services overview
### AWS is a ssytem of on-demand services that include the folowing services such as:
* #### VM-Virtual machines
* #### IaaS-infrastructure as a service
* #### Paas-Platfrom as a service
### these services are serverless and container based

###
## Amazon EC2
### Amazon EC2 is what helps to give virtual machines the product as as service demand. IaaS infrastucture leave plenty of room for flexibilty as they can be build to fit the needs of specific roles. Fromt the chosign the operating system and ghe size of it's required resources adn capabilities for the servers. Virtual Machines have similar concepts to as phhysical systems. 

    "With Amazon EC2, you can launch any number of instances of any size into any Availability Zone anywhere in the world in a matter of minutes."
    This quote expaling the great benefits to using EC2 and AWS for cloud services and for Visturla machines. 


## Amazon EC2 cost optimization 
### Amazon offers different pricing models to choose from when you want to run EC2 instances it also provides plenty of priciign models for Amazon EC2 that help customers save money. Customer are to able to combine multiple tyoes of services and help them acheive better rates regarding their necesity and capcity needs. 
* #### Per Second Billing
* #### On-Demnad
* #### Dedicated Hosts
* #### Dedicated Instances
* #### Reserved Instance
* #### Scheduled Reserved Instances
* #### Spot-Instances

## container services
### Containers are a method of operating system virtualiaztion. They allow you to use applications and the dependencies in resource-isolated processes. Using containers gives you the access to easily package an applications code and configuration to better productivity. Containers are also smaller and deliver enviromental consistency since the package is in a single object. Applications on containers run quickly, reliable, and consistently. 

### Dockers are software platfroms that package software (i.e. applications) into containers. They are also installed on each server thta will host containers it also gives simple commands that you use to vuild start or stop contaoiners. 

## Introduction to AWS Lambda
### AWS Lambda is ana event-driven serverless compute service, which enables you to run code without provisionign or managing servers. 
    "You pay only for the compute time you consumeâ€”youare notcharged when your code is not running."
    This quote provides specific details about why it is important to discuss how your time is managed and where you will save your money. 
### AWS Lambda supports multiple programming languages and completly automates the administration. The infrastructure for the code allows you to manage and focus on buildign backend services. 
## Introduction to AWS Elastic Beanstalk 
### Elastic Beanstalk is another AWS compute service a PaaS wihch facilitates ther quick deployment, scaling and management of your web applications and services. SImply uploading the code and allowing Elastic Beanstalk to automaticlally handle the deployment, and from capacity provisioning and load balancing to automatic scaling and monitoring application health.
