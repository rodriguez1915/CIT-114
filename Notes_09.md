# Cloud Architecture 
# _________________________________________________
## AWS Wel-Architected Framework 
### Architecture is the art and science of designing and building large structures. Large systems require architects to manage their size and complexity. 
#### Cloud architects:•
* Engage with decision makers to identify the business goal and the capabilities that need improvement.
* Ensure alignment between technology deliverables of a solution and the business goals.
* Work with delivery teams that are implementing the solution to ensure that the technology features are appropriate.

### Having well-architected systems greatly increases the likelihood of business success
#### The AWS Well-Architected Framework is a guide that is designed to help you build the most secure, high-performing, resilient, and efficient infrastructure possible for your cloud applications and workloads. It provides a set of foundational questions and best practices that can help you evaluate and implement your cloud architectures. AWS developed the Well-Architected Framework after reviewing thousands of customer architectures on AWS
* The AWS Well-Architected Framework provides a consistent approach to evaluate cloud architectures and guidance to help implement designs.
* The AWS Well-Architected Framework documents a set of design principles and best practices that enable you to understand if a specific architecture aligns well with cloud best practices.
* The AWS Well-Architected Framework is organized into six pillars.
* Each pillar includes its own set of design principles and best practices


## Reliability and Availability 

### Reliability-
#### is a measure of your system’s ability to provide functionality when desired by the user. Because "everything fails, all the time," you should think of reliability in statistical terms. Reliability is the probability that an entire system will function as intended for a specified period. Note that a system includes all system components, such as hardware, firmware, and software. Failure of system components impacts the availability of the system.

### Availability-
#### is the percentage of time that a system is operating normally or correctly performing the operations expected of it (or normal operation time over total time). Availability is reduced anytime the application isn’t operating normally, including both scheduled and unscheduled interruptions

    Three factors that influence the availability of your applications are fault tolerance, scalability, and recoverability.

#### You can design your workloads and applications to be highly available, but there is a cost tradeoff to consider

## AWS Trusted Advisor 
* AWS Trusted Advisor is an online tool that provides real-time guidance to help you provision your resources by following AWS best practices.
* AWS Trusted Advisor looks at your entire AWS environmentand gives you real-time recommendations in five categories.
* You can use AWS Trusted Advisor to help you optimize your AWS environment as soon as you start implementing your architecture designs
